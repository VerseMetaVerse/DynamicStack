# TheNewSuperStack

A highly opinionated MetaVerse friendly Modern Stack that is like a warm summer breeze of fresh air and above all, fun to work with into the next decade. Designed to deliver stunning apps that delight users, grab their attention and deliver real insight and usefulness that keeps your users coming back for more. Highly opinionated means careful selection of tech components to achieve these goals effiently and NOT a kitchen sink of popular frameworks to please everyone. If you like the ideas here, stick around and if this proves hard to understand in a comfortable way, the vast sea of GitHub is a welcoming resource to all!



# It Has To Breathe, Vibrant With Pulsing Life, Dynamic

You can't get to that with the Old Ways of Front-End and Back-End which miss all the potential channels of information and communication

# The MetaVerse is Coming

MetaVerse-First Design is the new first. There are different visions of what a MetaVerse might be and our vision is NOT about VR but about a new Super-Experience of community, engagement with your Design and a strong sense of being there which makes your design based on TheNewSuperStack superceding and unforgettable to your user base.

# Opinionated GitHub

GitHub has grown so huge that endless "me too" repos are just NOISE. The approach to a *Modern Stack* presented here may not appeal to you and that is just fine because as long as everyone starts to strive for greater diversity, you will find what you are looking for in the vast sea of GitHub!

# The Tech Components of a Modern Stack for 2024 and Beyond

## IAC - Infrastructure As Code

Pulumi is brilliant, installs independently on Linux and Windows and has no old school dependency baggage such as Terraform or Ansible.

## Navigating the Monster Sea That Kubernetes has Become

When a tool grows exponetialy to sucks out all your time and resources and wants to eat your brain for lunch, strict discipline to subset it into the back corner with an electroprod is required.

## The Time Has Come To Place the GPU Front and Center on the Stack

- Modern GPU far more processing power than the CPU

## Thriving in the Polyglot

- Everything that does anything is expressed through a programming language
- Great OSS comes in many languages
- Selecting a reasonably small number that provide cross platform execution
- Accept the need to switch from one to another if you want to benefit from OSS

### The List

- Verse
  - A new Functional and Object Language by the creators of Haskell targeted to handle the vast scale of The Metaverse

- Python
  - Avoid using Python due to 10X slower than the others in 2024! But you can't avoid it because it is the primary language of AI research. Try to keep it out of any critical performance paths.

# Data in Motion

Data is the pulsing heart of your application. It comes in many forms and moves through Pipelines.

- Fast RAM based stores are an essential front line in the performance your users crave!
- Graph DBs give your users the insight they need.
- Stream processing can feed some of the Pipelines
- Time-Series
- Data Lakes
- AI Processing Everywhere

# Cloud Native Integrated with On-Prem and Local

- If you can't run your Stack local, you don't understand it!

# Digital Twins

- The key technology to turn data into wisdom. Stacks without Digital Twins are a self imposed lobotomy!

# UX that is actually modern

- by far the largest number of neurons in the human brain are devoted to visual processing
- but in some sort of mass developer delusion we have become used to low bandwidth presentation of the data insight all apps are created to do
- So, GPU-first approach
- Unreal Engine
- supplemented with OS Native tech
- looking for your ancient low bandwitdh JavaScript framework? Not in a Modern Stack!
- Of course some people will pretend that their new computer with powerful GPU can only peer dimly at data inside a web browser and you probably want to search out one of the million Retro Stacks that do that, but when and if this pathway is needed we suggest WASM and will provide that as the third alternative.
