# TheNewSuperStack
The New Thing is Native - Cloud Native - GPU Native - AI Native - Data Native - OS Native - Mobile Native - MetaVerse Native -to delight Users First and if DX is the Hard Way, that's Reality

# It Has To Breathe, Vibrant With Pulsing Life, Dynamic

You can't get to that with the Old Ways of Front-End and Back-End which miss all the potential channels of information and communication

# The MetaVerse is Coming

MetaVerse-First Design is the new first. There are different visions of what a MetaVerse might be and our vision is NOT about VR but about a new Super-Experience of community, engagement with your Design and a strong sense of being there which makes your design based on TheNewSuperStack superceding and unforgettable to your user base.

# Opinionated GitHub

GitHub has grown so huge that endless "me too" repos are just NOISE. The approach to a *Modern Stack* presented here may not appeal to you and that is just fine because as long as everyone starts to strive for greater diversity, you will find what you are looking for in the vast sea of GitHub!

# The Tech Components of a Modern Stack for 2024 and Beyond

## IAC - Infrastructure As Code

Pulumi is brilliant, installs independently on Linux and Windows and has no old school dependency baggage such as Terraform or Ansible.

## Navigating the Monster Sea That Kubernetes has Become

When a tool grows exponetialy to sucks out all your time and resources and wants to eat your brain for lunch, strict discipline to subset it into the back corner with an electroprod is required.

## The Time Has Come To Place the GPU Front and Center on the Stack

- Modern GPU far more processing power than the CPU

## Thriving in the Polyglot

- Everything that does anything is expressed through a programming language
- Great OSS comes in many languages
- Selecting a reasonably small number that provide cross platform execution
- Accept the need to switch from one to another if you want to benefit from OSS

### The List

- Verse
- Python
- C#
- F#
- Java
- Scala
- C++
- Rust

# Data in Motion

Data is the pulsing heart of your application. It comes in many forms and moves through Pipelines.

- Fast RAM based stores are an essential front line in the performance your users crave!
- Graph DBs give your users the insight they need.
- Stream processing can feed some of the Pipelines
- Time-Series
- Data Lakes
- AI Processing Everywhere

# Cloud Native Integrated with On-Prem and Local

- If you can't run your Stack local, you don't understand it!

# Digital Twins

- The key technology to turn data into wisdom. Stacks without Digital Twins are a self imposed lobotomy!

# UX that is actually modern

- by far the largest number of neurons in the human brain are devoted to visual processing
- but in some sort of mass developer delusion we have become used to low bandwidth presentation of the data insight all apps are created to do
- So, GPU-first approach
- Unreal Engine
- supplemented with OS Native tech
- looking for your ancient low bandwitdh JavaScript framework? Not in a Modern Stack!
- Of course some people will pretend that their new computer with powerful GPU can only peer dimly at data inside a web browser and you probably want to search out one of the million Retro Stacks that do that, but when and if this pathway is needed we suggest WASM and will provide that as the third alternative.
