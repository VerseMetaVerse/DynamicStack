# TheNewSuperStack
The New Thing is Native - Cloud Native - GPU Native - AI Native - Data Native - OS Native - Mobile Native - MetaVerse Native -to delight Users First and if DX is the Hard Way, that's Reality

# It Has To Breathe, Vibrant With Pulsing Life, Dynamic

You can't get to that with the Old Ways of Front-End and Back-End which miss all the potential channels of information and communication

# The MetaVerse is Coming

MetaVerse-First Design is the new first. There are different visions of what a MetaVerse might be and our vision is NOT about VR but about a new Super-Experience of community, engagement with your Design and a strong sense of being there which makes your design based on TheNewSuperStack superceding and unforgettable to your user base.

# Opinionated GitHub

GitHub has grown so huge that endless "me too" repos are just NOISE. The approach to a *Modern Stack* presented here may not appeal to you and that is just fine because as long as everyone starts to strive for greater diversity, you will find what you are looking for in the vast sea of GitHub!

# The Tech Components of a Modern Stack for 2024 and Beyond

## IAC - Infrastructure As Code

Pulumi is brilliant, installs independently on Linux and Windows and has no old school dependency baggage such as Terraform or Ansible.

When a tool grows exponetialy to sucks out all your time and resources and wants to eat your brain for lunch, strict discipline to subset it into the back corner with an electroprod is required.

## The Time Has Come To Place the GPU Front and Center on the Stack

- Modern GPU far more processing power than the CPU

## Thriving in the Polyglot

- Everything that does anything is expressed through a programming language
- Great OSS comes in many languages
- Selecting a reasonably small number that provide cross platform execution
- Accept the need to switch from one to another if you want to benefit from OSS
